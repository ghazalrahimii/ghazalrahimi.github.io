            <h2> Contemporary Reflection </h2>
            <p> In continuation of the theme of Persian/Islamic patterns that have laid the foundation for my recent body of works, Complementary Reflections explores the ideas embedded in the medium of mirrors. Traditionally in Iran, mirror mosaics have been used in the ornate architecture of royal palaces and holy places. The consecutive reflections of light create a sense of allure, whether through highlighting the divinity of an atmosphere or through accentuating the glitz and glitter of a noble estate. By breaking down mirrors into smaller tiles, the reflection is also transformed into a fraction of the image, symbolically breaking down the viewerâ€™s pride. In a modern interpretation of mirrors as a metaphoric medium, one take is that they have a voyeuristic nature. Building on the historic and contemporary takes of this mysterious medium, the methodical installation is twofold in that it embodies both a poetic message and a more sinister one.</p>
